# lafayette911.org output processing

This is a perpetual script I keep working on as I get better with Python.
This script scrapes http://lafayette911.org for data and attemps to clean it up and make it presentable as JSON or some easily retreivable data.

the lafayette911.json file is an example of how I have the data outputting as of right now.
It's just a list pushed into a JSON file, with the last entry being when the script was last run.
```
    ["2820  LOUISIANA AV L  LAFAYETTE,LA Hazardous Material09/05/2021 - 15:16P F ", "Last Ran - 09/05/2021, 15:48:29"]
```
