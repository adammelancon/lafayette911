# lafayette911.org output processing
---------------------------------------
UPDATE!!!!
I finally got the JSON directly from the site.  See the folder for the Pi Pico W script to see how I'm using the data.
---------------------------------------


This is a perpetual script I keep working on as I get better with Python.
This script scrapes http://lafayette911.org for data and attemps to clean it up and make it presentable as JSON or some easily retreivable data.

the lafayette911.json file is an example of how I have the data outputting as of right now.
It's just a list pushed into a JSON file, with the last entry being when the script was last run.
```

```
